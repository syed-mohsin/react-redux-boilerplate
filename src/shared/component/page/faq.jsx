            <p>
              No. We do not take a fee or commission from manufacturers or resellers
              and you will be in touch with the supplier directly.  We just provide the
              information so you can start a discussion with a supplier that’s appropriate
              for your exact needs.

              Yes, we encourage manufacturers to ask their customers to write reviews
