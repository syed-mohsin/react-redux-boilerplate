## Overview

Solar companies today lack a good way of sifting through thousands of high-quality solar suppliers and products. Companies rely on either Google searches or costly trade shows to find solar suppliers. Search engines fail because suppliers do not rank high in search results. Trade shows are cost-prohibitive for small companies and inefficiently filter for quality suppliers. As a result, most companies do business with a handful of suppliers and significantly overpay on solar projects.

Braquet solves this problem by providing a catalog where a community of solar professionals can find and review suppliers based on product, price, and services. This solution will drive down the cost of solar projects by up to 70%, bring greater transparency to the industry, and unite a fragmented market of thousands of solar developers and suppliers.
